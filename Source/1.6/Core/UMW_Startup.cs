// injected — the earliest point where settings that override def fields can be
// applied. (The Mod constructor is too early: it runs while mod assemblies are
// still loading, before any def exists.)
//
// Once per PROCESS, not per play-data load: StaticConstructorOnStartupUtility.CallAll goes through
// RuntimeHelpers.RunClassConstructor, and a type initializer never runs twice. An in-process
// play-data reload (mid-session language change, dev-mode def hot reload) rebuilds the DefDatabase
// WITHOUT re-running this, so until the next restart the def-field overrides revert to their
// shipped XML values (re-applied on the next settings-window close, which calls the same Apply
// methods) and the caches built here keep the previous DefDatabase's def instances (harmless to the
// pool/stuff patches, which key on tags and defNames, not cached references).
// (Decompile-verified, RimWorld 1.6.)
