// Identity is the UMW_UniqueMelee thingSetMakerTag rather than a defName prefix or the mod's
// ContentPack, because that tag is already the contract our reward pool selects on (see
// ThingSetMaker_UMWUnique and UMW_Reward_UniqueWeapon) — one marker, one meaning. Changing Tag means
// changing the weapon defs and our pool def's filter in lockstep.
//
// All is derived from the DefDatabase rather than hand-listed, which is what makes every consumer
// DLC-correct with no ModsConfig check: a MayRequire-gated weapon (the Royalty axe and warhammer) never
// enters the DefDatabase without its DLC, so it is simply absent — including from the per-weapon settings
// rows. Ordered by label so those rows have a stable, alphabetical order. The cache is rebuilt from
// UMW_Startup, which re-runs on a play-data reload (where the DefDatabase itself is rebuilt).
