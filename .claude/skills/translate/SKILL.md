description: Generate, update, or audit mod localization (Keyed + DefInjected) for a target language, grounded in vanilla RimWorld terminology. Use when asked to add a language, update translations, or check translation freshness.
argument-hint: "[language, e.g. German | update | check]"
---

# Translate

Produce or refresh localization files for Unique Melee Weapons. English is
the source of truth; every other language derives from it.

## Non-negotiables

- **Run the checker first and last.** `python3 Scripts/check-translations.py`
  validates key sets, placeholders, DefInjected paths, staleness, and file
  hygiene deterministically. Never hand-derive anything it reports; never
  finish with it failing.
- **Community translations are owned by their contributors.** Update
  stale/missing keys in an existing language when asked, but do not rewrite a
  contributor's phrasing wholesale without the user's explicit direction.
- **Machine-assisted output is a first pass.** PRs and commits containing
  generated translations must say so and invite native-speaker review.
- **Keep the public roster current.** CONTRIBUTING.md's localization table
  (Planned / Machine-assisted / Native, plus credit) must be updated in the
  same commit whenever a language is added or a native review lands. The
  target roster lives there — consult it before proposing new languages.

## File map and conventions

- English Keyed source: `1.6/Languages/English/Keyed/UMW_UI.xml` (settings
  window) and `UMW_Stats.xml` (info-card trait-effect lines).
- Most player-facing text lives in the defs themselves
  (`1.6/Defs/**`) — weapon/trait/hediff/thought/ability labels and
  descriptions, quest letter text, name-grammar rulesStrings — and is
  translated per language via DefInjected, not Keyed.
- Target layout: `1.6/Languages/<Language>/Keyed/*.xml` and
  `1.6/Languages/<Language>/DefInjected/<DefTypeFolder>/*.xml`
- `<DefTypeFolder>` must be the def's resolvable type name: bare for vanilla
  types (`ThingDef`, `WeaponTraitDef`, `HediffDef`, `AbilityDef`,
  `QuestScriptDef`, ...). This mod currently defines no Def subclasses of its
  own (audited 2026-07); if one is ever added, its folder must be
  **namespace-qualified** (`UniqueMeleeWeapons.<DefClass>`) — a bare custom
  name silently drops every translation in the folder.
- **The type folder is load-bearing, not organizational** (decompile-verified,
  `Verse.LoadedLanguage`): RimWorld enumerates only the top-level directories
  under `DefInjected/` and resolves each directory *name* to the def type its
  files target. An `.xml` placed directly in `DefInjected/` is never loaded,
  and the checker likewise iterates only directories — a misplaced file fails
  silently on both sides, so never flatten the tree. *Inside* a type folder
  everything is free: file names are arbitrary and files are found recursively,
  so one bundled file per type vs one-def-per-file is pure preference — this
  repo bundles per type, since reviewers work in whole-language passes and
  entries are found by their defName-prefixed keys, not by file. (The loader
  even tolerates a pluralized folder name by retrying with the last character
  stripped — `ThingDefs` → `ThingDef` — but the checker does not; use exact
  type names.)
- DefInjected keys are `DefName.field` paths (`UMW_LongSword_Unique.label`,
  `UMW_Earthshake.description`). Translate `label`, `description`, and the
  long tail of secondary fields this mod actually uses: `traitAdjectives`
  (all WeaponTraitDefs) and `namerLabels` (all weapon ThingDefs' comps),
  which feed generated unique names; hediff `labelNoun`, injury-comp labels
  (`labelTendedWell`, `permanentLabel`, `destroyedLabel`, ...) and stage
  labels; thought `stages` labels/descriptions; DamageDef `deathMessage`;
  FactionDef `pawnSingular`/`pawnsPlural`/`leaderTitle`; and quest
  `rulesStrings` grammar. The checker warns on uncovered label/description;
  the rest it validates structurally once present.
- The name-generation grammar (`RulePackDefs/`, and the `stuff_adjective`
  symbol it consumes) is translatable content, not fixed data: its
  rulesStrings carry English adjectives/nouns that each language rewrites to
  produce natural names in that language.
- **EN comment convention (required):** every translated entry carries the
  current English source directly above it:
  `<!-- EN: Reset to defaults -->` — this is how the checker detects
  staleness.
- Formatting: UTF-8 without BOM, LF endings, 2-space indent, final newline,
  root element `<LanguageData>`.
- Placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, named args) must match English exactly per key.
  Translator comments above placeholdered English keys explain what gets
  injected — injected values are lowercase def labels; phrase around them
  accordingly.

## Terminology grounding (do not skip)

Every game term must match the official localization, not a plausible
translation. Sources, in order:

1. Vanilla language data:
   `"$RIMWORLD_PATH"/Data/<Expansion>/Languages/<Language> (<Native>).tar`
   (read entries with `tar -xOf`). Check Core plus Odyssey (this mod's DLC),
   and Royalty (the `MayRequire`-gated ultratech traits borrow its melee
   kit).
2. This file's glossary below (lessons already learned — apply them).
3. If a term appears nowhere official, flag it in the PR for native review
   rather than inventing silently.

Terms that MUST be grounded before use: weapon trait, unique weapon, the
base melee weapon names we mirror (longsword, spear, mace, knife, and the
Royalty pair), quality tiers, material/stuff names (wood, plasteel, uranium,
jade, ...), Royalty's ultratech melee weapons for the ultratech trait
descriptions (English labels are fused lowercase words: "monosword",
"plasmasword", "zeushammer" — ground each language's forms from the Royalty
tar), damage/condition terms (EMP,
stun, burn, bleeding), and the opportunity-site quest vocabulary
(ancient mercenaries, bandit camp, item stash).

### Glossary — shared across the mod family

The RU and JP rows were learned in the companion mod (UWU) from native review
(RU) and vanilla-data study (JP); the Simplified Chinese, Korean, German, Spanish
and French sections were learned in this repo's 2026-07 generations. Lessons
propagate across all three repos
(here, ../UniqueWeaponsUnbound, ../PersonaWeaponsUnbound): when a row is added
or corrected in one skill, mirror it into the siblings, adjusting
domain-specific rows. Add rows whenever a native review lands corrections.

#### Russian (from UWU PR #6 native review)

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| trait (weapon) | свойство | черта | vanilla `WeaponTraits`=Свойства; черта = pawn personality traits |
| charge (weapons) | энерг- root | заряд- | vanilla `Gun_ChargeRifle`=энерговинтовка; заряд reads as ammo |
| Cancel (button) | Отменить | Отмена | vanilla `Cancel`; buttons use infinitive verbs |
| report/inspect strings | noun phrases | finite verbs | matches inspect-pane convention |

#### Japanese (from UWU machine-assisted generation, 2026-07, extended by this
repo's melee/quest pass, 2026-07)

RimWorld's language folder is `Japanese` (tar: `Japanese (日本語).tar`).

Style rules discovered from the vanilla JP data (mandatory):

- Vanilla JP uses ASCII punctuation: `,` and `.` — never `、` or `。`.
- Descriptions/tooltips: polite です/ます form ending `.`; labels/buttons no
  period. Thought (`ThoughtDef` stage) descriptions are the exception — plain
  first-person form, no です/ます.
- Quote injected def labels and cross-referenced UI labels with 「」. Suffixes
  and parentheticals take no leading space and use ASCII parens.
- `traitAdjectives` are **attributive** forms ending in の / な / い / a verb
  (Odyssey ships 探知の, 正確な, 灼熱の). The JP namer concatenates with no
  space, so a bare noun reads broken.
- Name grammar: no spaces around [symbols]; "The X of Y" → `[Y]の[X]`; vanilla
  keeps `[RECIPIENT_possessive]` (unlike zh, which drops it).
- `stuffProps.stuffAdjective` is `〜製` (鉄製, プラスチール製, 木製, ヒスイ製),
  so `[stuff_adjective]の[noun]` composes cleanly — supply the の in our rules,
  matching vanilla's の-terminated trait adjectives.
- Battle-log entries end in plain past tense (よけた, 受け流した) and JP
  `[skillAdv]` values are adverbials (巧みに, ゆっくりと), so `[skillAdvMaybe]`
  slots directly before the verb.
- `deathMessage` keeps vanilla's space after the pawn token: `{0}は 斬られて…`.
- DLC names stay in Latin script (Odyssey, Royalty), as does MOD.

|---|---|---|---|
| trait (weapon) | 特性 (stats-entry title 武器の特性) | 特性・特徴 | `WeaponTraits` / `StatsReport_WeaponTraits` / Odyssey `Stat_ThingUniqueWeaponTrait_Label`; 特性・特徴 is Royalty's *persona*-weapon word (`Stat_Thing_PersonaWeaponTrait_Label`) and belongs to PWU's domain, not ours |

| toxic buildup | 毒物が蓄積 | | Core `ToxicBuildup` |
| item stash / bandit camp / ancient mercenaries / sealed crate | 埋蔵品 / 盗賊の野営地 / 古代の傭兵 / 密封されたクレート | | Core sites, Odyssey quest + `AncientSealedCrate` |
| abandoned settlement / tribesfolk / chief | 放棄された集落 / 蛮族 / 族長 | | Core `AbandonedSettlement`, `TribeRough` |

| Traders will pay more/less for it. | 貿易商は高値で/低い価格でこれを買い取ります. | | Odyssey `GoldInlay`/`Ugly` descs — reuse verbatim |

The six Odyssey trait ports (`Lightweight`, `Cumbersome`, `Ornamental`,
`Ugly`, `GoldInlay`, `JadeInlay`) have official JP labels, adjectives and — for
four of them — descriptions that our English matches word for word; copy them
rather than retranslating.

Mod-decided terms pending native review (from the 2026-07 commit): 受け流し
(parry, register-matched to `TextMote_Dodge` 回避), 戦士団 (warband, parallel
to vanilla 傭兵団), 襲撃団 (war party), 頭目 (warlord), 鍔 / クロスガード
(quillons / crossguard), 地響き (earthshake), 鼓舞の叫び (rallying cry),
士気高揚 (rallied), 由緒ある (storied), 杭打ちヘッド (piledriver), アヘン塗布
(opiated), 琺瑯 (enameled), 無反発 (dead-blow, from the real tool term
無反発ハンマー), 稜付き (flanged), 鋲打ち (studded), 徹甲スパイク (armor
spike), 先重心 (head-weighted), 素早い (quickdraw — vanilla's 早撃ちの is
ranged-specific and wrong on melee).

#### Simplified Chinese (from this repo's machine-assisted generation, 2026-07)

RimWorld's language folder is `ChineseSimplified` (tar: `ChineseSimplified
(简体中文).tar`) — the mod's folder must match it exactly, whatever the
public roster calls the language.

Style rules discovered from the vanilla zh data (mandatory):

- Full-width punctuation in prose (，。、；：（）……); descriptions end with 。;
  labels and buttons carry no trailing period. Placeholders, digits and units
  stay ASCII. Vanilla labels use full-width parens: 锻造台（燃料）.
- Quote cited names in prose with full-width curly quotes — vanilla writes
  任务“{0}”. Terse stat templates take no quotes ({0}伤害).
- `traitAdjectives` are bare attributive words with no trailing 的: the zh
  Odyssey namer composes both [weapon_adjective]的[weapon_noun] and
  [weapon_adjective][weapon_type], so each must read both ways. Avoid weak
  single characters (快 → 迅疾).
- Name grammar: no spaces around [symbols]; zh links with 的 and 之 and drops
  English "The" ("The X of Y" → Y之X). Material names compose directly:
  [stuff_adjective][weapon_noun] → 钢铁长剑, [stuff_adjective]之[badass_noun]
  → 翡翠之獠牙.
- Battle-log grammar: zh [skillAdv] entries end in 地, so an optional
  [skillAdvMaybe] slots cleanly before the verb; [RECIPIENT_possessive] is
  idiomatically dropped (vanilla zh does the same).
- Vanilla zh files can contain untranslated English values (Odyssey's
  ancient-mercenaries name symbols) — vanilla incompleteness is not style
  guidance. Some vanilla zh files carry a BOM; ours never do.

(piledriver), 阿片 (opiated), 珐琅 (enameled), 无回弹 (dead-blow).

#### Korean (from this repo's machine-assisted generation, 2026-07)

RimWorld's language folder is `Korean` (tar: `Korean (한국어).tar`). Decompile-
verified why the paren-stripped name works: `LoadedLanguage` derives
`legacyFolderName` by cutting at `(`, and mod language dirs match on *either*
`folderName` or `legacyFolderName` — the same mechanism behind `Japanese`.

**Josa (particle) markers are the one hard mechanical rule Korean adds, and
nothing else in this skill has an equivalent.** Korean particles are
allomorphic: the correct form depends on whether the previous syllable ends in
a consonant, which is unknowable when the preceding text is an injected value.
`Verse.LanguageWorker_Korean.ReplaceJosa` (decompile-verified) resolves exactly
eight tokens, and no others:

```
(이)가   (와)과   (을)를   (은)는   (아)야   (이)어   (으)로   (이)
```

- Every *allomorphic* particle following `{0}`, `[symbol]` or `[TOKEN_x]` MUST use
  a marker. `{0}(을)를 생성` is correct; `{0}를 생성` breaks on consonant-final
  labels. Only five distinctions inflect (은/는, 이/가, 을/를, 와/과, 으로/로);
  **`에`, `에서` and `의` are invariant** — write those bare after a placeholder.
- Never hand-roll `{0}을(를)` — the worker does not recognize it.
- **Spelling is exact, and `(와)과` is asymmetric.** For every token the paren
  holds the post-*consonant* form — except `(와)과`, where `JosaPatternPaired`
  maps to `("과","와")`, so the paren holds the post-*vowel* form. `(과)와` matches
  nothing and ships literally.
- **A marker resolving off a digit is always wrong.** `HasJong()` falls back to
  `AlphabetEndPattern` = `{b,c,k,l,m,n,p,q,t}` for non-Korean chars, which has no
  digits, so a number always yields the vowel form — right for 2/4/5/9
  (이·사·오·구), wrong for 1(일) 3(삼) 6(육) 7(칠) 8(팔) 0(영). Phrase around it
  (`{1} x{2} 예약에 실패했습니다`), never mark it. Same list means a Latin tail is
  consonant-final only for those nine letters, so `Odyssey` → `y` → vowel form.
- **Quoting interacts with resolution.** `FindLastChar` skips a preceding `"`,
  `'` or `)` (walking back past the matching `(` and any spaces) to reach the real
  final character, so `"{0}"(을)를` resolves correctly. Curly `“ ”` and corner
  `「 」` are **not** skipped: they fall through to `default`, and
  `char.IsLetterOrDigit('”')` is false, so the token is returned unresolved and
  the raw `(은)는` shows on screen. Korean therefore needs no defensive quoting at
  all — josa does the job quoting does in ja/ru/zh.
- The one safe unmarked case, which vanilla ko itself uses: a symbol that always
  resolves the same way, e.g. `[refugee_pronoun]는` (Korean pronouns are always
  vowel-final). Def labels, pawn names, material words and numbers are never safe.
- A lint for this lives outside the repo checker (which is language-agnostic).
  It was calibrated to zero false positives against the vanilla ko Keyed corpus,
  Odyssey's WeaponTraitDefs and Core's DamageDefs. Four patterns fooled earlier
  drafts and must stay excluded: `(와)과의` (valid token plus ordinary trailing
  `의`), `기간 (일)` (a parenthetical unit, not a marker), bare `0으로` (no marker,
  so untouched and already correct), and `{2}(으)로` (correct authoring; only a
  *literal* digit before a marker is provably wrong).

Other style rules discovered from the vanilla ko data (mandatory):

- ASCII punctuation (`.` `,`), never `。`. Descriptions/tooltips take polite
  formal `-습니다.`/`-입니다.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments take no
  trailing period.
- `ThoughtDef` stage descriptions are the exception: casual first-person
  (`-어`, `-지`, `-군`, `-거야`), e.g. vanilla `이제 거의 깼어.`
- Battle-log rulesStrings end in the nominalized `-함.`/`-임.` form, not polite
  form (`Combat_Dodge`: `… [implement](을)를 [skillAdvMaybe] 피함.`).
- Korean **uses spaces**, unlike JP/zh: the ko namer composes
  `[weapon_adjective] [weapon_noun]` with a space, so `traitAdjectives` may be
  attributive verb forms (`가벼운`, `저주받은`) *or* bare noun modifiers
  (`황금`, `신속`, `특제`). Genitive epithets carry their own `의` (`죽음의`).
- Korean drops English "The" in name grammar and links with `의`
  (`[badass_concept]의 [weapon_type]`). Material composes bare:
  `[stuff_adjective] [weapon_noun]` → 강철 장검.
- Vanilla ko **drops `[RECIPIENT_possessive]`** in the combat packs — 12
  textual occurrences, all in EN comments, zero in Korean values. Korean omits
  possessive pronouns, so follow suit rather than rendering 그의.
- Units attach with no space: `{0}시간`, `{0}일`, `{0}칸`. Some vanilla ko
  files carry a BOM; ours never do.

**Cross-checked against PWU's own ko pass (landed the same day, independently
grounded).** It reached the same josa conclusion, and adds two findings worth
reusing: `LanguageWorker_Korean.FindLastChar` skips a preceding `'`/`"`, so
quoting an injected label and *then* attaching a josa resolves correctly; and
`AlphabetEndPattern` contains no digits, so a josa directly after a number
always picks the no-batchim form and is wrong for 1/3/6/7/8/0 — phrase around
it. Two rows genuinely diverge, and neither repo should silently "fix" the other:

- **PWU's `mechanite` → 나노머신 row is wrong; use 기계입자.** PWU grounded on
  Royalty/Biotech only and concluded ko has no term for it. Core in fact has one
  in 7 files (`Hediffs_Local_Infections`, `Luciferium`, `Items_Exotic`, ...):
  all 36 English "mechanite" occurrences render 기계입자. 나노머신 is Core/Biotech's
  word for English *nanomachines*. Correct this when mirroring.
- **armor penetration: 방어 관통력 here, 관통력 in PWU — both correct.** Core
  Keyed `ArmorPenetration` is 관통력, but the StatDef this mod's info-card lines
  sit under is `MeleeWeapon_AverageArmorPenetration` = 근접 방어 관통력. Match
  whichever anchor the surrounding screen shows.

The six Odyssey trait ports have official ko labels/adjectives, and descriptions
that match our English verbatim for four of them (장식용, 난잡한 외형, 금 상감,
옥 상감); `Lightweight` 경량 and `Cumbersome` 불편 differ only in aim-vs-swing,
so adapt that clause alone. Note Odyssey's `Ugly` adjective *indices* differ
from ours: re-map by meaning (crude=조잡한, ugly=난잡한, monstrous=끔찍한).

#### German (preseeded from PersonaWeaponsUnbound's 2026-07-28 generation,
generated and extended here 2026-07-28)

Base rows were ground against the de Core/Royalty/Ideology/Odyssey tars during
PWU's run; this repo's full melee/quest/naming pass confirmed them and resolved
the two questions PWU had left open (stuff naming, and whether `namerLabels`
need markers — both answered by vanilla data, see below). Language folder is
`German` (tar: `German (Deutsch).tar`).

Style rules from the vanilla de data (mandatory):

- **ASCII single quotes** for cited def labels and UI labels — vanilla writes
  `Forschungsprojekt '{0}'`. Core+Royalty Keyed ship 140 single-quoted
  placeholders and **zero** German `„…"`. Never use `„ "`, `» «`, or curly
  quotes. Pawn names are not quoted.
- **En dash `–`, never em dash `—`** (20 vs 0). English source uses `—`, so every
  dash needs converting; `<!-- EN: -->` comments keep the English form verbatim.
- Ellipsis is ASCII `...` (74 in Core Keyed, `…` zero).
- Descriptions end with `.`; labels and buttons take none. Player-facing prose is
  informal **du** with imperatives, never Sie.
- `JobDef.reportString` and `RecipeDef.jobString` are third-person **with** a
  terminal period (`wendet TargetB an.`, `Stellt Hightech-Bauteil her.`) —
  unlike ja/ko, which take none. `RecipeDef.label` is `X herstellen`, no article.
- Research labels are lowercase noun phrases (Hightech-Fabrikation, lange
  Klingen, mehrläufige Waffen) or verb-final phrases (Bier brauen).

**The trait row collapses in German.** This repo's RU glossary hangs on
свойство-not-черта, because RU uses a different word for pawn traits. German has
no such split: Odyssey's `Stat_ThingUniqueWeaponTrait_Label`, Royalty's
`Stat_Thing_PersonaWeaponTrait_Label` **and** Core's pawn-trait `<Traits>` are
all **Merkmale**. The disambiguating form, when no weapon context is present, is
vanilla's own `StatsReport_WeaponTraits` = **Waffenmerkmale**. Run the lookup
anyway — just expect it to come back the same.

**Case is the German landmine, not gender** (decompile-verified:
`Verse.GrammarResolverSimple`, `LanguageWorker_German`, `LanguageWordInfo`).
`"key".Translate(args)` reaches `GrammarResolverSimple`, not the rulepack
resolver. Its `obj is string` branch *does* support `{0_gender ? m : f : n}`,
`{0_definite}`, `{0_indefinite}`, `{0_plural}` on a plain string, resolving
gender from the word itself via `WordInfo/Gender/{Male,Female,Neuter,Other}.txt`
(~2450 nouns in Core). But it implements **no `lookup` function**, so
`{lookup: {0}; decline; N}` — the only route to the 2457-row `decline.txt` case
forms — silently fails, and de's article helpers are nominative-only. So gender
is solvable, case is not: restructure any oblique slot rather than guessing an
article. Two live cases in this repo, both plain-string injections:
`UMW_ExcludeWoodStuffDesc` (`MeleeWeapon_LongSword.label` = Langschwert, neuter)
and `UMW_WeaponEnabledDesc` (`weapon.label` — a **mod-coined** label, absent from
the Gender tables, so `ResolveGender` falls back to its `defaultGender` of
**Male** and `{0_gender ? …}` becomes a silent coin-flip). Reserve the gender
symbols for vanilla nouns in nominative slots.

**`RulePackDef` naming grammar works completely differently in German, and this
is the finding that matters most here.** Odyssey's de
`RulePacks_Namers_UniqueWeapons.xml` tags every noun with its gender inline and
strips the marker with `{replace:}` to emit the right article and adjective
ending:

```
<li>badass_noun_gender->|M|Mäher</li>
<li>badass_noun_gender->|F|Witwe</li>
<li>badass_noun_gender->|N|Ende</li>
<li>weapon_adjective_weapon_noun->{replace: [weapon_noun]; "|M|"-"[weapon_adjective]er "; "|F|"-"[weapon_adjective]e "; "|N|"-"[weapon_adjective]es "}</li>
<li>the_badass_concept->{replace: [badass_concept]; "|M|"-"Der "; "|F|"-"Die "; "|N|"-"Das "}</li>
<li>of_the_badass_concept->{replace: [badass_concept_gender_gen]; "|M|"-"des "; "|F|"-"der "; "|N|"-"des "}</li>
<li>weapon_noun_ungendered->{replace: [weapon_noun]; "|M|"-""; "|F|"-""; "|N|"-""}</li>
```

Adopt that shape for any de naming grammar here: a `*_gender` symbol carrying
`|M|`/`|F|`/`|N|`-prefixed nouns, plus `{replace:}` wrappers per syntactic slot
(bare, definite, genitive, adjective-agreeing), and an `_ungendered` variant that
strips the marker where no agreement is needed. A bare noun list with no markers
cannot be inflected at all. **Caveat:** in that same vanilla file the
*scaffolding* is German but several leaf lists (`badass_adjective`,
`badass_concept`) are still English (grim, eternal, justice, revenge) — vanilla
incompleteness, exactly as noted for zh. Copy the technique, never the vocabulary.

**Two def fields this mod owns feed straight into that machinery, so German
constrains their *form*, not just their wording:**

- **`namerLabels` must each carry a `|M|`/`|F|`/`|N|` prefix**, marker then noun,
  no space (`|N|Langschwert`). Odyssey's own de namerLabels do: `|M|Großbogen`,
  `|N|Sturmgewehr`, `|F|Büchse`, `|F|schwere MP`. Odyssey's `{replace:}` slots are
  what emit the article and adjective ending, so an unmarked label leaves the strip
  with nothing to match and generates a broken name. Nothing in the checker sees
  this — it validates the key path, not the value's shape.
- **`traitAdjectives` must be uninflected adjective stems** that read correctly with
  `-er`/`-e`/`-es` appended (strong) and `-e`/`-en` after a definite article (weak),
  because `weapon_adjective_weapon_noun` concatenates the ending. Odyssey de ships
  `leicht`, `schnellziehbar`, `unhandlich`, `sperrig`, `klobig`, `schön`, `elegant`,
  `verziert`, `golden`, `vergoldet`, `jadeverziert`, `grässlich`, `primitiv`,
  `hässlich`, `zielsuchend`, `treffsicher`, `präzis`, `lahmlegend`, `EMP-verstärkt`.
  A **noun** is never valid here (`Panzerdorn` + `es`), nor is a stem ending in
  `-e`/`-er`, nor one containing a space. This is the inverse of ja/ko/zh, where the
  same field wants an attributive *phrase* — do not port those rules to German.

Two more German mechanics from `LanguageWorker_German`, neither visible to the
checker:

- `PostProcessed` rewrites a trailing English `'s` to `s` (or a bare `'` after
  s/ß/z/x/ce). A closing ASCII single quote immediately followed by lowercase `s`
  is silently mangled — never write `'{0}'s`.
- `PostProcessThingLabelForRelic` truncates a weapon label to its bare weapon
  noun via `EndsWith` against a hardcoded 26-noun list: Horn, Lanze, Pulser,
  Werfer, Axt, Flinte, Bogen, Revolver, Gewehr, Stoßzahn, Stab, Hammer, Schwert,
  Pistole, Dolch, Büchse, Kanone, Granaten, Granate, Keule, Säbel, Messer,
  Rapier, Klinge, Sense, Speer; on no match it keeps only the substring after the
  last space or hyphen. **Directly relevant to this repo's `ThingDef` weapon
  labels** — a de label ending outside those 26 nouns yields a poor relic name.
  Note Waffe is *not* on the list; Schwert, Hammer, Klinge, Messer, Speer,
  Keule, Axt and Stab are.

**Stuff naming inverts in German, which directly affects this repo's
`stuff_adjective` symbol.** Core de's `ThingMadeOfStuffLabel` is `{1} aus {0}`
where English is `{0} {1}` — "wooden longsword" is "Langschwert aus Holz", not
"hölzernes Langschwert". Correspondingly de Core defines
`stuffProps.stuffAdjective` for only 9 defs, because the prepositional frame
replaces the adjective — **and every value is a bare noun built for that dative
frame**: `Holz`, `Gold`, `Granit`, `Marmor`, `Kalkstein`, `Schiefer`,
`Sandstein`, `Vakuumstein`, and decisively `Leather_Heavy` = **`dickem Fell`**,
already dative-inflected. Our `stuff_adjective` symbol falls back to the stuff's
`label` when `stuffAdjective` is absent, which in German is likewise always a
noun (`Stahl`, `Plastahl`, `Uran`, `Jade`, `Silber`).

**So this is settled by vanilla data, not a native call: use the `aus
[stuff_adjective]` frame.** It composes correctly for every material including
the pre-inflected one ("aus dickem Fell"), and it needs no gender agreement on the
material at all. Concretely, in `UMW_NamerStuffAdjectives`, **drop English's
`weapon_adjective->[stuff_adjective]` rule** — Odyssey's namer would append
`-er/-e/-es` to it and yield "Stahler" — and build `r_weapon_name` patterns on the
`aus` frame instead, reusing Odyssey's own `[weapon_noun_ungendered]` to strip the
gender marker (and noting its `badass_noun` list is unmarked, so it is safe bare).
Dropping a rule and adding others is fine: the checker enforces no `<li>`-count
parity on list-valued entries.

**Inside a rulepack the FULL resolver runs, so `lookup` *is* available** — the
opposite of §"Case is the German landmine", which applies only to `.Translate()`.
Vanilla de rulepacks use `{lookup: [INITIATOR_label]; decline; 2}` freely.
`decline.txt`'s column order is
`NOM;1_GEN;2_DAT;3_ACC;4_NOM_DEF;5_GEN_DEF;6_DAT_DEF;7_ACC_DEF`. It is a table of
**nouns**, so it resolves a pawn-kind label but not a proper name — prefer
restructuring over relying on it.

**Never *print* a `[X_definite]'s` genitive in German.** English name-grammar and
battle-log source is full of it; German cannot form a genitive by suffixing a
nominative definite phrase ("der Pirat" + s → "der Pirats"). Vanilla de contains 63
occurrences — **all in `<!-- EN: -->` comments** — and only 4 in actual German
values, every one of them inside a `{replace: …; " [INITIATOR_label]'s [WEAPON_label]"-""}`
that *deletes* the English construction before appending a `{lookup: …; decline; …}`
form. So keep the attacker a **nominative subject** and restructure the clause
(`[INITIATOR_definite] holte aus, doch [RECIPIENT_definite] parierte den …`). Note
this is the exact mirror of the ko lesson, where `[RECIPIENT_possessive]` was
comment-only: check comments-vs-values before copying a symbol usage from the tar.

**German keeps `[RECIPIENT_possessive]` and inflects it inline** by appending the
ending — `von [RECIPIENT_possessive]er Panzerung`, `gegen [RECIPIENT_possessive]e
Panzerung`, `mit [RECIPIENT_possessive]em Handschutz` (55 uses in Core combat packs).
Unlike ko, do **not** drop it.

**Battle-log `rulesStrings` are Präteritum** (`wich … aus`, `verfehlte`, `prallte …
ab`, `sprang zur Seite`) — not the nominalized ko form and not polite ja form. De's
`[skillAdv]` values are adverbs/adjective stems (`ungeschickt`, `geschickt`,
`meisterhaft`, `kunstvoll`), so an optional `[skillAdvMaybe]` composes cleanly as
`[skillAdv] geführten` before a masculine accusative noun.

**Quest descriptions must strip `[discoveryMethod]`'s case markers.** In German that
symbol resolves to a sentence frame containing `|thing_nom|` / `|thing_gen|` /
`|thing_dat|` / `|thing_acc|` plus four `_embedded` variants (see Core
`Keyed/Letters.xml` → `LetterNewQuest`). Every consumer `{replace:}`s all eight and
supplies its own noun phrase declined four ways — Odyssey's
`Script_AncientMercenaries.xml` is the worked example and the direct template for
this repo's warband quest, which reuses the same symbol. Miss this and a raw
`|thing_dat|` ships to screen. Odyssey's de file also supplies the reusable
renderings `eine einzigartige Waffe von [WEAPON_quality]er Qualität` and
`{LEADER_gender ? den Anführer : die Anführerin} einzufangen oder zu töten`.

**`questSubjectRules` needs extra case families in German:** alongside
`questMapFeature`, Odyssey de adds `questMapFeatureGenIndef` and
`questMapFeatureDatIndef` (`einer Militärgarnison`), because `Description_Map`
consumes the oblique forms. Supply all three families.

The six Odyssey trait ports have official de labels and adjectives, and four
have descriptions matching our English word for word — copy those verbatim
(`verziert`, `hässlich`, `vergoldet`, `jadeverziert`). `Lightweight` (`leicht`)
and `Cumbersome` (`unhandlich`) differ only in aim-vs-swing, so adapt that clause
alone. As in ko, Odyssey's `Ugly` adjective *indices* differ from ours: re-map by
meaning (crude=`primitiv`, ugly=`hässlich`, monstrous=`grässlich`). `Lightweight`'s
"nimble" has a Core anchor — the Gladius description's `leicht und wendig`.

Mod-decided terms pending native review (from the 2026-07-28 commit), all
uninflected stems where they are trait adjectives: `Panzerdorn` (armor spike),
`Widerhaken` (barbed), `glockengegossen` (bell-cast), `blutbefleckt`
(blood-stained), `karbonisiert` (carbonized), `Gegengewicht` (counterweighted),
`rückschlagfrei` (dead-blow), `emailliert` (enameled), `vergiftet` (envenomed),
`gerippt` (flanged, flanges = `Schlagrippen`), `kopfschwer` (head-weighted),
`monomolekular`, `Nadelspitze` (needle point), `opiatbeschichtet` (opiated),
`Rammkopf` (piledriver), `plasmaumhüllt` (plasma-cored), `Parierstangen`
(quilloned; quillon/crossguard = `Parierstange`, third synonym `Handschutz`),
`rasierscharf` (razored), `gezahnt` (serrated), `geschichtsträchtig` (storied),
`genietet` (studded, studs = `Nieten`), `Zeuskopf` (zeus-headed, capacitor =
`Zeus-Kondensator`); `parieren`/`Pariert` (parry, register-matched to
`Ausgewichen`), `Erdstoß` (earthshake), `Schlachtruf` (rallying cry), `angespornt`
(rallied), `Sedierung` (sedative buildup), `ausgefranst` (ragged),
`meistergeschmiedet` (master-forged), `Kriegerbande` (warband),
`Kriegerbandenlager` (warband camp), `Kriegszug` (war party), `Stammeskrieger` /
`Stammesraider` (tribal warrior/raider, on Core's dominant `Raider`),
`Spalter` (cleaver), and the colours `blutrot` / `karbonschwarz` / `emailviolett`
/ `monomolekularweiß` / `plasmaorange` (patterned on Odyssey's
`eisblau`/`feuerorange`).

#### Spanish (Castellano) (from this repo's machine-assisted generation, 2026-07-29)

RimWorld ships **two** Spanish languages: `Spanish (Español(Castellano)).tar` and
`SpanishLatin (Español(Latinoamérica)).tar`. The roster's "Spanish" means the
Castilian one, so the mod folder is `Spanish` (the parenthetical is stripped by
`legacyFolderName`, same mechanism as `Japanese`/`Korean`). A LatAm pass would be a
separate `SpanishLatin` folder, not an edit to this one.

`Verse.LanguageWorker_Spanish` is decompiled and **imposes no hidden authoring
requirements** — no `PostProcessed` override (unlike German), no particle system
(unlike Korean). It prepends `el/la/los/las` and `un/una/unos/unas` from the word's
gender, returns names unchanged, has full `Pluralize` rules plus a `plural.txt`
lookup, and renders ordinals `N.º`. Notably it does **not** contract `de el`/`a el`
— see below, that is the author's job.

Style rules from the vanilla es data (mandatory):

- **ASCII straight double quotes** for cited def labels: vanilla writes
  `La misión se llama "{0}".` — 7689 ASCII `"` against **7** curly `“` and **zero**
  guillemets `«»`. Do not port ja's 「」, ru's «», or zh's “”.
- **Inverted opening marks are required**: `¿…?`, `¡…!` (168 / 433 in Core).
- **Zero dashes.** Core+DLC contain **no** em dashes and **no** en dashes, so an
  English `—` must be **reflowed**, not converted. This is the opposite of German,
  which mandates `–`.
- Ellipsis is ASCII `...`. Descriptions end `.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments
  take none, and labels are lowercase noun phrases.
- **Informal tú with imperatives**, decisively: Explora 12 / Explore 0, Asegúrate
  41 / Asegúrese 0, `tu colonia` 61 / `su colonia` 3.
- **Adjectives postpose and agree in gender + number.** So `unique <weapon>` is
  `<arma> único/única` — Odyssey ships `arco grande único`, `escopeta automática
  única`, `minigun única`.
- Two different gender hedges, and the right one depends on the field: a
  `deathMessage` takes the inline resolver form (`{0} ha muerto quemad{0_gender ?
  o : a}.`), while a bare-participle `injuryProps.destroyedLabel` takes a
  capitalized `(a)` (`Lacerado(a)`, `Seccionado(a)`, `Quemado(a)`).
- `labelNoun` **carries the indefinite article** (`un corte`, `una puñalada`, `una
  quemadura`) — the same shape German has and ja/ko/zh don't.

**Spanish solves name-grammar gender by SPLITTING SYMBOLS, not by tagging nouns.**
Odyssey's es `NamerUniqueWeapon` keeps parallel families — `badass_concept` (M) vs
`badass_conceptF` (F), `concept` vs `conceptF` — and writes one rule per gender
(`[weapon_type] del [badass_concept]` / `… de la [badass_conceptF]`). There are no
inline `|M|`-style markers and no `{replace:}` gender stripping. Consequences:

- **`namerLabels` are bare lowercase nouns with NO markers** — the exact inverse of
  German. Odyssey's es namer never puts an article or an agreeing adjective beside
  `[weapon_type]`, precisely because its gender is unknowable there, so nothing
  needs marking.
- **`traitAdjectives` must be GENDER-INVARIANT**, because they postpose straight onto
  a weapon noun of either gender (`[weapon_type] [trait_adjective]` → `espada larga`
  F or `martillo de guerra` M). Two legal shapes, both used throughout Odyssey's own
  es trait file: an invariant adjective (`-e`, `-al`, `-ar`, `-z`, `-ista`, `-ble`,
  `-il` — `torpe`, `elegante`, `ornamental`, `ágil`, `veloz`, `brillante`,
  `horripilante`), or a **prepositional phrase** (`de oro`, `de jade`, `de adorno`,
  `de gran tamaño`, `de manejo torpe`, `con buscador`). A bare `-o`/`-a` adjective is
  silently broken on half the weapons. Note the trait's own `label` is a different
  field and *may* inflect — Odyssey uses default masculine (`ligero`, `feo`).
  Also keep such an adjective **material-neutral**: a universal trait rolls on wood,
  jade and plasteel too, so `de acero carbonizado` is wrong where
  `de superficie carbonizada` is right.
- **Weapon names carry no definite article at all** in Odyssey's es patterns. Drop
  English's "The" rather than trying to supply `el`/`la`.
- **es redefines `weapon_adjective` as a prepositional phrase**, not an adjective
  (`weapon_adjective->del [concept]` / `de la [conceptF]`). Its `badass_adjective`
  list survives but is referenced by no rule — dead weight in es.

**`de el` → `del` and `a el` → `al` must be contracted by hand.** `[X_definite]`
emits `el …` already wrapped in a colour tag, so Core es fixes this 89 times with the
colour code baked into the search pattern:

```
{replace: de [RECIPIENT_definite]; "de &lt;color=#D09B61FF>el "-"&lt;color=#D09B61FF>del "}
{replace: a [RECIPIENT_definite]; "a &lt;color=#D09B61FF>el "-"&lt;color=#D09B61FF>al "}
```

Feminine (`de la pirata`) and named pawns (`de Roberto`, no article) simply don't
match and pass through untouched, which is correct. **Core es also ships a shorter
variant, `{replace: de [X]; ">el "-">del "}` (20 uses in `RulePacks_CombatRanged`),
and that one is buggy** — it leaves the literal `de ` outside the match and renders
"de del proyectil". Copy the full form only. The alternative is to restructure so no
`de`/`a` precedes a `_definite` symbol.

**`[RECIPIENT_possessive]` resolves to `su` and has NO plural form** — Core
`Keyed/Grammar.xml` sets `Prohis`/`Proher`/`Proits` all to `su`. Since Spanish `su`
agrees in number with the *possessed* noun, the symbol is only safe before a
**singular** noun; `[RECIPIENT_possessive] gavilanes` would ship "su gavilanes" every
roll. Use the definite article for plurals (`los gavilanes`), which is also the more
idiomatic Spanish for one's own equipment. This is a third distinct answer to the
possessive question: ko drops the symbol, de keeps and inflects it, es keeps it only
in the singular.

**Battle-log `rulesStrings` are preterite** (`evitó`, `falló`, `vaciló`, `se tropezó`,
`se tambaleó`, `se resbaló`, `saltó`) — not the perfect. es `[skillAdv]` values are
adverbs (`incompetentemente`, `ineptamente`), and Core places `[skillAdvMaybe]`
*before* the verb.

**The stuff frame inverts, and here the `weapon_adjective` rule SURVIVES** (unlike
German, where it had to be dropped). Core es `ThingMadeOfStuffLabel` is `{1} de {0}`,
and es `stuffProps.stuffAdjective` values are bare nouns (`acero`, `plastiacero`,
`madera`, `jade`, `oro`, plus pre-framed `piel gruesa` / `cuero ligero`). Because es
`weapon_adjective` is *already* prepositional, `weapon_adjective->de
[stuff_adjective]` composes correctly with every Odyssey pattern (`espada larga de
acero`, `filo de plastiacero`). Build the `r_weapon_name` patterns on the same `de`
frame, article-free.

**Quest grammar is markedly simpler than German's.** `[discoveryMethod]` carries no
case markers in es — Odyssey uses it bare (`[discoveryMethod] la ubicación de una
infame compañía de mercenarios.`) — so there is nothing to `{replace:}` away, and
`questSubjectRules` needs only the plain `subject` / `questMapFeature` /
`questMapText` families, with no genitive/dative variants. Two Odyssey es renderings
are worth reusing verbatim: `un arma única: [WEAPON_quality]` (a colon sidesteps
quality-adjective agreement) and `Si logras capturar o matar al líder, puedes tomar
su arma.`

**The trait row collapses in Spanish, exactly as it does in German.** Odyssey's
`Stat_ThingUniqueWeaponTrait_Label`, `WeaponTraits` **and** Core's pawn-trait
`Traits` are all **Rasgos**; the disambiguated form is vanilla's own
`StatsReport_WeaponTraits` = **Rasgos del arma**. Royalty's *persona* word is
`Características` (PWU's domain, not ours). Run the lookup anyway; expect a collision.

The six Odyssey ports have official es labels, adjectives and — for four of them —
descriptions matching our English word for word (`ornamental`, `feo`, `incrustación
de oro`, `incrustación de jade`); copy those verbatim. `Lightweight` (`ligero`) and
`Cumbersome` (`torpe`) need only their aim-vs-swing clause adapted. As in ko and de,
Odyssey's `Ugly` adjective *indices* differ from ours: re-map by meaning
(crude=`de aspecto horrible`, ugly=`horripilante`, monstrous=`horrible`).

Mod-decided terms pending native review (from the 2026-07-29 commit), every trait

garrison"), `filo de navaja` (razored), `serrado`, `de renombre` (storied), `con

#### French (from this repo's machine-assisted generation, 2026-07-29)

Language folder is `French` (tar: `French (Français).tar`).

**`LanguageWorker_French` rewrites every string, and this is the finding that shapes
everything else** (decompile-verified). Its `PostProcessed` runs five regexes in order:

```
ElisionE   \b(ce|de|je|le|me|ne|se|te|que|quoique|lorsque) + vowel   → c' d' j' l' m' n' s' t' qu' ...
ElisionLa  \bla + vowel                                             → l'
ElisionSi  \bsi il(s)                                               → s'il(s)
DeLe       \bde le(s)                                               → de / des
ALe        \bà le(s)                                                → au / aux
```

**So French is the inverse of Spanish: never hand-contract.** Where Core es needs
`{replace: de [X_definite]; "de &lt;color=…>el "-"…del "}`, French writes `de` / `le` /
`la` plainly and the worker fixes it — including inside rulepacks and `.Translate()`
output. Vanilla fr relies on this: `le [attack_noun]` renders "l'assaut", `dégâts de
{1}` renders "dégâts d'immolation", `en or`/`en argent` need nothing. Two traps in it:

- **`de le` becomes `de`, not `du`.** Group 2 captures only `e`/`es`, so `de les X`
  correctly yields "des X" but `de le X` yields "de X". Core fr ships this bug (`a
  [destroyed_past] [destroyed_targets] de [RECIPIENT_definite]` → "la jambe de pirate").
  Never write `de [X_definite]`; restructure so the entity is a subject, or use an
  agent phrase — **`par [X_definite]` never contracts** and is the clean escape.
- **`IsVowel` includes `h`**, so the worker cannot tell *h muet* from *h aspiré* and
  elides both: `la hache` → "l'hache", `de hampe` → "d'hampe". Never place an
  elidable word directly before an h-initial noun. (This mod's axe is `hache`, so it
  matters here.)

`WithDefiniteArticle`/`WithIndefiniteArticle` are **overridden**, handling `l'` before a
vowel and `le`/`la` by gender directly — so the Keyed `DefiniteForm`/`IndefiniteForm`
templates are dead code in French, and `[X_definite]` is reliable for pawns. `Pluralize`
knows `-al`→`-aux`, `-au`/`-eu`→`+x`, and leaves `s`/`x`/`z` alone. `OrdinalNumber` gives
`1er`, `2e`.

Style rules from the vanilla fr data (mandatory):

- **Formality is `vous`, decisively** — 564 `vous` against **zero** `tu`/`Tu` in
  Core+DLC Keyed (`Assurez-vous` 15 / `Assure-toi` 0, `votre colonie` 30). This is the
  opposite of German and Spanish, both of which are informal. Imperatives are the
  vous form (`Explorez`, `Faites attention`).
- **ASCII straight double quotes** for cited def labels: `La quête s'appelle "{0}".` —
  356 ASCII `"` against 14 guillemets `«»` (inconsistently spaced) and **zero** curly
  `“`. Do not port the ja/zh/ru quote marks.
- **ASCII apostrophe `'`**, not `’` (1991 vs 65) — and this is load-bearing, not
  cosmetic: the elision worker emits ASCII `'`, so a curly one would not match.
- **A space before `:` `;` `!` `?`**, per French typography — 727 ` :` against 30 tight,
  plus 239 ` ?` and 91 ` !`. It is a **plain ASCII space**, not a no-break or narrow
  space (only 13 of those exist in the whole corpus). Vanilla fr itself slips here
  (Odyssey's `Le groupe contient:`); write the space.
- **Zero dashes.** Core+DLC hold 1 em dash and 6 en dashes, i.e. none — an English `—`
  must be **reflowed**, as in Spanish and unlike German, which mandates `–`. Ellipsis
  is ASCII `...`.
- Descriptions end `.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments take none, and labels are
  lowercase noun phrases.
- **`ThoughtDef` stage descriptions are the register exception**: first-person present
  and informal (`Je suis à la limite de vaciller.`, `J'ai l'impression d'avoir…`), never
  vous-form.
- Gender hedging inside a string uses **inline word-splitting**, the French idiom:
  `{0} a été taillad{PAWN_gender ? é : ée : é(e)} à mort.`, `{PAWN_gender ? un : une :
  un(e)}`. Note both arities occur — the 3-arg form when a genderless subject is
  possible, the 2-arg `détendu{PAWN_gender ? : e}` where it is not. A bare-participle
  `injuryProps` label instead takes a capitalized `(e)`: `Déchiqueté(e)`, `Perforé(e)`.
- `labelNoun` **carries the indefinite article** (`une taillade`, `un coup de lame`,
  `une brûlure`) — the shape de and es share and ja/ko/zh lack.

**French solves rulepack gender with RULE-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS — a fourth technique,
distinct from German's inline `|M|` markers and Spanish's parallel symbol families.**
Core fr writes one rule per agreement class and lets the resolver pick:

```
<li>staggered(p=3,SUBJECT_gender==Male)->est stupéfait</li>
<li>staggered(SUBJECT_gender==Female)->est stupéfaite</li>
<li>staggered(SUBJECT_gender==None)->est stupéfait</li>
<li>verb_genericattack(INITIATOR_gender!=Female)->s'est rué</li>   <!-- shorthand for Male+None -->
```

**Always cover `None`** (or use `!=Female`): a missing branch fails to resolve for
genderless pawns, i.e. mechanoids. But reach for this only when you must, because:

**Battle-log `rulesStrings` are passé composé with *avoir*** (`a esquivé`, `a dévié`, `a
évité`, `a échoué`, `a titubé`) — not es's preterite and not de's Präteritum. A participle
with *avoir* does **not** agree with the subject, which is why most Core fr combat lines
need no gender handling at all. It *does* agree with a **preceding direct object**, so if
a line uses an object pronoun (`l'a reçu`), every noun that pronoun can stand for must be
the same gender — pick the symbol's values accordingly rather than adding gender rules.
fr `[skillAdv]` values are adverbials (`maladroitement`, `avec habileté`, `de manière
incompétente`) and Core places `[skillAdvMaybe]` **after** the verb.

**`[X_possessive]` is structurally wrong in French, and this is a fourth distinct answer
to the possessive question.** Core `Keyed/Grammar.xml` sets `Prohis`=`son`,
`Proher`=`sa`, `Proits`=`son/sa`, so the symbol resolves from the **possessor's** gender
— but French `son`/`sa` agrees with the **possessed noun**. The symbol therefore keys off
the wrong entity no matter what. Counting values rather than comments proves vanilla
agrees: **1471 occurrences in `<!-- EN: -->` comments, 24 in actual values, and all 24 are
broken** (Anomaly's `[RECIPIENT_possessive]de son travail` renders "sonde son travail";
Odyssey's `de [PAWN_possessive]` renders "le visage de son"). Core's combat packs write the
possessive literally instead — `[deflecting] son armure` — and so should you. So: ko drops
the symbol, de keeps and inflects it, es keeps it only before a singular noun, **fr
replaces it with a literal possessive agreeing with the possessed noun.**

**Odyssey's French `NamerUniqueWeapon` is not merely incomplete, it is broken, and none of
it may be copied.** It defines four parallel symbol families —
`badass_adjective_feminine`, `badass_noun_feminin` (note the inconsistent spelling),
`badass_noun_vowel`, `badass_adjective_indef` — that **no rule references**, so every one
is dead; its rules hardcode a masculine `Le [weapon_type]`; it inverts the English
possessives (`[ANYPAWN_nameIndef] du [weapon_noun]` for "X's reaper"); and the translator
left their own unresolved question in the file as `<!-- WeaponType feminine/masculine? -->`.
The practical consequence is that vanilla fr generates "Le lance" and (via h-aspiré
elision) "L'hache" for unique weapons whatever a mod does, because that rule lives in
Odyssey's def and mods can only *add* alternatives to it. Keep your own
`r_weapon_name` patterns **article-free** so they are at least correct, and don't try to
repair Odyssey's.

Two def fields this mod owns, both constrained by that namer:

- **`traitAdjectives` must be GENDER-INVARIANT** — the same requirement Spanish has, for
  the same reason (they postpose onto a `[weapon_noun]` of unknowable gender), and it
  bites harder here: this mod's roster is four feminine weapons (`hache`, `épée longue`,
  `masse`, `lance`) against three masculine (`glaive`, `couteau`, `marteau de guerre`), so
  a masculine-default adjective is wrong more often than right. **Odyssey's own fr file
  violates this throughout** (`léger`, `légère`, `lourde`, `gênante`, `perçante`, `laid`,
  `exacte`, plus plurals like `surdimensionnées`), which mostly survives on its almost
  entirely masculine gun roster — do not copy the adjectives even for the six ports whose
  labels and descriptions you do copy. Two legal shapes, both attested in that same file:
  a **prepositional phrase** (`à …`, `de …`, `en …`, `au …`, `sans …`, `d'…` — vanilla ships
  `sur mesure`, `à percussion`, `de choc`, `à sabot`, `haute capacité`), or an adjective
  already invariant in gender, i.e. one whose masculine form ends in `-e` (`agile`,
  `féroce`, `magnifique`, `malcommode`, `infâme`, `mono-moléculaire`). An invariant colour
  compound (`rouge sang`, `noir carbone`) also works.
- **`namerLabels` are bare lowercase nouns with NO marker** — as in Spanish, the inverse of
  German. Odyssey's fr namer never places an agreeing adjective or article beside
  `[weapon_type]`, precisely because its gender is unknowable there.

**The stuff frame is `en`, and it needs no elision work at all.** Core fr
`ThingMadeOfStuffLabel` is **`{1} en {0}`** ("épée longue en acier"), and fr
`stuffProps.stuffAdjective` values are bare nouns. So build the `stuff_adjective` rules on
`en [stuff_adjective]`: it composes with Odyssey's postposing `[weapon_noun]
[weapon_adjective]` pattern, and unlike a `de` frame it cannot trip the `de le` bug.
Keep English's `weapon_adjective->[stuff_adjective]` rule but make it prepositional (as in
es; de had to drop it). **Trap: `Steel.stuffProps.stuffAdjective` is `métal`, not
`acier`** — the label and the stuff adjective differ, so a steel weapon reads "épée longue
en métal". Verify per material rather than assuming the label.

**Quest grammar is the simple kind, like Spanish's.** `[discoveryMethod]` carries no case
markers and is used bare (`[discoveryMethod] l'emplacement d'une infâme compagnie de
mercenaires.`), so there is nothing to `{replace:}` away, and `questSubjectRules` needs
only the plain `subject` / `questMapFeature` / `questMapText` families — no oblique
variants. Two Odyssey fr renderings are worth reusing verbatim: `une arme unique
[WEAPON_quality]` and `Si vous parvenez à capturer ou à tuer le chef, vous pouvez prendre
l'arme unique.`

**`unique <weapon>` is the easy case here:** `unique` is invariant in gender and
postposes, so one form serves every weapon — Odyssey ships `arc long unique`, `fusil
d'assaut unique`, `minigun unique`. No es-style `único/única` or de-style ending needed.

**The trait row does NOT collapse in French.** Odyssey's `WeaponTraits` is `Traits d'arme`
and `Stat_ThingUniqueWeaponTrait_Label` is `Traits`, while Core's pawn-trait section header
is `Éléments marquants :` — a different word entirely, unlike de (`Merkmale`) and es
(`Rasgos`), where weapon and pawn traits collide. Royalty's *persona* label is also
`Traits`, but that is PWU's domain.

copy those verbatim. `Lightweight` (`léger`) and `Cumbersome` (`encombrant`) need only
their aim-vs-swing clause adapted. As in ko, de and es, Odyssey's `Ugly` adjective
*indices* differ from ours, so re-map by meaning — but replace all six ports' adjectives
with invariant forms per the rule above.

`accumulation de sédatif` with the stage ladder `dosé`/`vaseux`/`sous sédatif`, `taillade
déchiquetée` / `perforation déchiquetée` (ragged), `forgé par un maître` (master-forged),
`bande de guerre` (warband), `camp de la bande de guerre`, `troupe de guerre` (war party),
**`chef de guerre`** (warlord — Core's `Warlordess56.title` is `machine de guerre`, a loose
rendering that does not mean warlord, so this one is a coinage), `couperet` (cleaver),
`mailloche` (maul), `taillant` (bit), `épieu` (lance), `pique` (pike), `gourdin`
(bludgeon), and the colours `rouge sang` / `noir carbone` / `violet émail` / `blanc
mono-moléculaire` / `orange plasma` (patterned on Odyssey's `bleu glacier` / `orange feu`).

### Cross-language lessons

- Wrap injected `{0}` def labels in the language's quote marks (JP 「{0}」,
  RU «{0}», zh-Hans “{0}”) — injected labels never inflect, and quoting
  sidesteps case and agreement problems. **Korean is the exception, and porting
  the ja form actively breaks it**: ko solves the same problem mechanically with
  josa markers, and `FindLastChar` looks through only ASCII `'` `"` `)` to find
  the syllable that decides the particle. Curly `“ ”` and corner `「 」` are not
  skipped, so `「{0}」(을)를` silently ships an unresolved `(을)를`. Inject bare and
  mark the particle.
- **The same def field can demand a different part of speech per language, and no
  checker sees it.** `traitAdjectives` wants an attributive phrase in ja (`の`/`な`-
  terminated), a bare modifier in zh (no trailing `的`), either form in ko (spaces,
  so verb forms work), in de an **uninflected adjective stem** that a
  `{replace:}` appends `-er/-e/-es` to — a noun is silently broken there and fine
  elsewhere — and in es anything **gender-invariant**, i.e. an invariant adjective or
  a `de …` phrase, since it postposes onto nouns of both genders with no agreement
  machinery — and the same in fr, where the legal shapes are a prepositional phrase or
  an adjective whose masculine form already ends in `-e`. Likewise `namerLabels` is plain
  text in ja/ko/zh, must carry a `|M|/|F|/|N|` marker in de, and must be a **bare
  unmarked noun** in es and fr. Before translating a field that feeds name generation,
  read how the target language's vanilla namer *consumes* it, not just how it reads.
- **Gendered/inflecting languages solve name grammar in one of three ways, and you must
  find out which before writing any rulepack.** German tags each noun inline
  (`|M|Mäher`) and strips the marker with `{replace:}` per syntactic slot. Spanish
  instead keeps **parallel symbol families** (`badass_concept` / `badass_conceptF`)
  and writes one rule per gender. French uses neither: it puts a **constraint on the rule
  itself** (`staggered(SUBJECT_gender==Female)->est stupéfaite`), which the resolver
  selects on. The three are mutually exclusive: porting German's markers into Spanish
  ships literal `|M|` to screen, and porting Spanish's split into German loses the
  adjective endings. With the fr form, **always write the `==None` branch too** (or use
  `!=Female`) — a missing branch fails to resolve for genderless pawns, i.e. mechanoids.
- **Check whether the worker contracts before writing any contraction scaffolding — the
  answer inverts between languages.** Spanish must fuse `de`+`el` by hand in the rulepack
  with `{replace: de [X_definite]; "de &lt;color=#D09B61FF>el "-"&lt;color=#D09B61FF>del "}`,
  colour code and all. French must do the **opposite and write nothing**:
  `LanguageWorker_French.PostProcessed` elides `de`/`le`/`la`/`que` before a vowel and
  fuses `à le`→`au`, `de les`→`des` automatically, so hand-contracting would double-apply.
  **And vanilla is not uniformly right in either** — Core es ships a truncated variant of
  its idiom 20 times that renders "de del", and the fr worker turns `de le` into `de`
  rather than `du` while eliding *h aspiré* it should leave alone. Verify a vanilla
  pattern actually works before copying it; frequency is not correctness.
- **The possessive symbol has four different correct answers, so never generalize
  one.** ko drops `[RECIPIENT_possessive]` (Korean omits possessives), de keeps it and
  inflects it inline (`[RECIPIENT_possessive]em Handschutz`), es keeps it **only
  before a singular noun** (es `su` has no plural form, so a plural possessed noun
  needs the definite article instead), and fr **cannot use it at all**: French `son`/`sa`
  agrees with the *possessed* noun while the symbol resolves from the *possessor's*
  gender, so Core fr writes the possessive literally (`son armure`). Check
  `Keyed/Grammar.xml` for the language's actual `Prohis`/`Proher`/`Proits` values rather
  than assuming the symbol inflects — fr's are `son`/`sa`/`son/sa`, which is the tell.
- **A DamageDef and a HediffDef of the same name often have different labels**, and
  translating from the wrong one is an easy, invisible error: es Core has DamageDef
  `Stab`=`apuñalamiento` but HediffDef `Stab`=`puñalada`; ko has `찔림` vs `베임`; de has
  `Stich` vs `Stichwunde`. Always confirm which def *type* you are looking at.
- **When two vanilla files disagree, prefer the nearer analog, not the more central
  one.** es Core's generic ColorDefs render purple `morado`, but Odyssey's own
  `UniqueWeapon_*` colour defs — same def type, same purpose as ours — render it
  `púrpura`. The closer file wins.
- **Don't spend a vanilla word on the wrong slot.** es Core's `Anesthetic` stages
  already own `atontado` (woozy) and `sedado` (sedated); assigning `sedado` to a
  different stage of our own hediff forced an invented word for the stage that
  actually means it. Map a def's stages against vanilla's equivalent ladder *first*,
  then coin only for what is left over.
- **Keep a trait adjective material-neutral.** A universal trait rolls on every stuff,
  so an adjective naming one material ("de acero carbonizado") is wrong on the wooden
  and jade rolls. Name the feature, not the substrate.
- **Distinguish comment occurrences from value occurrences when mining the tar.**
  Grepping a symbol across a language's files counts English `<!-- EN: -->` text too,
  which inverts the conclusion: `[RECIPIENT_possessive]` looked used in ko but was
  comment-only (ko drops it), and `[INITIATOR_definite]'s` looks used in de (63 hits)
  but appears in only 4 values, all inside `{replace:}` blocks that *delete* it.
  Strip comments before counting.
- **Check for a `LanguageWorker_<Language>` before generating.** It post-
  processes every string, so it can impose authoring requirements no amount of
  reading the vanilla data will reveal as *mandatory* — Korean's josa markers
  are invisible until you find `ReplaceJosa`. Decompile it:
  `ilspycmd "$RIMWORLD_PATH/RimWorldWin64_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll" -t
  "Verse.LanguageWorker_<Language>"`. Languages with heavy inflection (Russian,
  Polish, Turkish, Czech, German) are the ones to check first. German's rewrites
  a trailing `'s`, so a closing ASCII single quote followed by lowercase `s` is
  silently mangled — and its `PostProcessThingLabelForRelic` truncates weapon
  labels against a hardcoded noun list, which matters for this repo's ThingDef
  labels. **A worker can also do work *for* you, which is just as important to know**:
  French's elides and contracts automatically, so the correct authoring there is to write
  the uncontracted form and leave it alone. Read the worker before deciding what to write,
  not only to find what it forbids.
- **Simulate the worker rather than reasoning about it.** Its regexes are short enough to
  reimplement in a few lines of Python, and running your actual strings through them
  catches what eyeballing does not — it is how the fr pass confirmed `en or` → "en or",
  `le assaut` → "l'assaut", `dégâts de IEM` → "dégâts d'IEM", and how it found that
  Odyssey's own `Le [weapon_type]` rule emits "Le lance" and "L'hache" no matter what a
  mod adds.
- **Vanilla's translation of the very def you are extending can be broken, not just
  incomplete — check that a file's symbols are actually *referenced* before copying its
  technique.** Odyssey's fr `NamerUniqueWeapon` defines four gender/vowel symbol families
  that no rule uses (so all four are dead), hardcodes a masculine article, inverts the
  English possessives, and carries the translator's own unresolved
  `<!-- WeaponType feminine/masculine? -->` question. "Vanilla does it" is not evidence
  it works; grep for the symbol on the *left* of `->` and on the right.
- **A pre-existing vanilla defect you cannot fix should still be recorded.** Our rulepacks
  are *added* to vanilla's namer, so a broken vanilla `r_weapon_name` keeps firing. Note
  it in the glossary and keep your own patterns correct rather than trying to repair
  theirs from a language folder.
- **Know which resolver your strings actually reach** (decompile-verified).
  `"key".Translate(args)` goes to `Verse.GrammarResolverSimple`, *not* the full
  rulepack `GrammarResolver`, and the two support different things. On a plain
  `string` arg `GrammarResolverSimple` gives you `{N_gender ? … : … : …}`,
  `{N_definite}`, `{N_indefinite}`, `{N_plural}` and the pronoun family — gender
  is looked up from the word itself via `LanguageWordInfo`, so no `NamedArgument`
  metadata is needed. It implements **no `lookup` function at all**, so
  `{lookup: {0}; decline; N}` and every case form it would produce are
  unavailable there. For inflecting languages that means gender is usually
  solvable and **case is not**: restructure so nothing has to agree with the
  injected label. See the German glossary for worked rewrites.
- **A gender lookup that misses defaults to masculine** (`ResolveGender`'s
  `defaultGender`), and this mod's own weapon labels are never in the vanilla
  Gender tables — so `{N_gender ? …}` on a UMW label is a silent coin-flip, not a
  fix. Reserve it for vanilla nouns in nominative slots. `UMW_WeaponEnabledDesc`
  is the live example.
- **Name-grammar gender is solved in the rulepack, not by the resolver** — by one of the
  three techniques above (de's inline markers, es's parallel symbol families, fr's
  rule-level constraints), never by the resolver's `{N_gender}`. A bare noun list cannot
  be inflected afterwards, so decide which technique applies before writing any
  `RulePackDef` entries, including the `stuff_adjective` symbol.
- **The checker compares argument placeholders, not grammar constructs, and that
  distinction is deliberate.** `{0}`/`{PAWN_labelShort}` are supplied by the C# call site
  and must match English exactly; `{PAWN_gender ? é : ée : é(e)}` is inflection the target
  language needs and uninflected English never has. `Scripts/check-translations.py`
  excludes any `{...}` containing `?` before comparing (see the comment on
  `GRAMMAR_CONSTRUCT_RE`), which is what lets fr render `Cut.deathMessage` the way Core fr
  does. Confirm the named argument exists at the call site before relying on one:
  `HealthUtility` passes `pawn.Named("PAWN")` alongside `{0}` specifically for this.
- When an English string is reworded, refresh the EN comments in every
  language **in the same commit** — the checker reports the mismatch as STALE
  either way, but batching avoids churn.
- Coined vanilla terms may be a portmanteau in one language and a plain word
  in another — always check, never extrapolate between languages.
- Mod-coined terms recur in def labels AND in Keyed settings prose that
  restates them. When generation is chunked across files or subagents,
  reconcile those terms across the whole language before committing (the
  zh-Hans run needed an alignment pass for earthshake / rallying cry /
  rallied / storied).

## Workflows

### Initial generation (`/translate <Language>`)

1. Run the checker; confirm English itself is clean.
2. Enumerate English Keyed keys and DefInjected-translatable def fields
   (mirror the structure of an existing language if one exists).
3. Extract the vanilla tar for the target language into the scratchpad;
   build a term list for the grounded terms above.
4. Translate via subagent(s) carrying: the glossary, the vanilla term list,
   the EN-comment requirement, placeholder rules, and formatting rules.
   Chunk by file section if the key count is large.
5. Run the checker (`--strict` for new languages); fix everything.
6. Review the diff yourself before committing. Commit message and PR text
   must state machine-assisted origin and invite native review.

### Update pass (`/translate update`)

1. Run the checker; it lists missing keys and stale entries per language.
2. Translate only that delta, refreshing each entry's EN comment.
3. Leave correct existing entries untouched. Re-run the checker.

### Audit only (`/translate check`)

Run the checker and report; change nothing.

## Optional in-game verification

RimWorld Dev Mode offers "Save translation report" and "clean up translation
files" (Verse.LanguageReportGenerator / TranslationFilesCleaner). These need a
running game with the mod loaded — useful as a final QA pass, not a substitute
for the checker.
