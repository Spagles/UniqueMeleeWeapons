// The gizmo for an ability whose CompAbilityEffect_GroundShockwave carries travelsThroughGround.
// Selected per-ability by AbilityDef.gizmoClass (a plain Type field that Ability.GetGizmos feeds to
// Activator.CreateInstance), so this needs no Harmony patch — see Defs/AbilityDefs/Earthshake.xml.
//
// Exists only to keep the hover preview honest, which this repo treats as a rule (see CLAUDE.md): the
// burst is flood-filled through conducting ground, so a plain radius ring would promise cells across a
// gap that the shock never reaches. Vanilla cannot draw that. Command_Ability.GizmoUpdateOnMouseover
// hands off to VerbProperties.DrawRadiusRing, whose only cell filter is a hardcoded
// GenSight.LineOfSight test behind drawHighlightWithLineOfSight — there is no hook for an arbitrary
// predicate, so the ring has to be drawn directly rather than configured. GenDraw.DrawRadiusRing's
// predicate overload is public and is the same one vanilla's line-of-sight path uses, so this is the
// vanilla drawing routine with a different filter, not a reimplementation of it.
//
// The preview and the burst call the SAME CompAbilityEffect_GroundShockwave.GroundConnectedCells with
// the same radius read off the same comp. That sharing is the point: it makes the ring structurally
// unable to disagree with the effect, rather than relying on two copies being kept in step.
