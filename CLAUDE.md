# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Unique Melee Weapons** is a RimWorld 1.6 mod that adds a collection of unique,
individually-designed melee weapons. Requires Harmony and the Odyssey DLC.

> The mod is freshly scaffolded — this file documents the build/deploy system and
> conventions. Fill in the **Content** and **Architecture** sections as weapons and
> any custom C# behaviour are added.

**Key Technologies:** C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2), Harmony library, RimWorld modding API, XML definitions

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the mod (outputs to 1.6/Assemblies/ AND atomically redeploys to the RimWorld Mods folder)
dotnet build UniqueMeleeWeapons.sln -c Release

# Build only the main project (also triggers the deploy)
dotnet build Source/1.6/UniqueMeleeWeapons.csproj

# Stage the mod into an arbitrary folder (used by CI; same manifest as the local deploy)
dotnet build Source/1.6/UniqueMeleeWeapons.csproj -c Release \
  -t:StageMod -p:StageDir=/path/to/output/UniqueMeleeWeapons
```

The build system auto-detects the RimWorld installation path on Windows/Linux/Mac (including WSL targeting a Windows install). For CI builds without RimWorld installed, it falls back to the `Krafs.Rimworld.Ref` NuGet package.

### Deployment

The repo lives in `~/dev/UniqueMeleeWeapons`, separate from the RimWorld Mods folder. Every local build redeploys automatically and atomically — there is no separate clean step to remember.

- **Single source of truth:** the file manifest lives in **one** place — the `_ModFiles` ItemGroup in the `StageMod` target of `Source/1.6/UniqueMeleeWeapons.csproj`. It's generic over the well-known RimWorld content folders — `About`, `Assemblies`, `Defs`, `Patches`, `Textures`, `Sounds`, `Languages`, plus root `LoadFolders.xml` — each matched at the mod root **and** under any version/`Common` folder (the `$(RepoRoot)/*/<Folder>` patterns), so a new version folder (a future `1.7/`) needs no change. Source layout is mirrored verbatim into `$(StageDir)` (via per-item `MakeRelative` metadata — note an inline `MakeRelative` inside an item transform evaluates only once, not per item). Dropping in e.g. a `Sounds/` folder deploys automatically; only a brand-new _file type_ needs a new line here.
- **Lean by extension whitelist:** only the formats RimWorld loads at runtime ship — `.dll` (no `.pdb`); `.xml` (Defs/Patches/Languages/About); `.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` (Textures); `.wav`/`.mp3`/`.ogg` (Sounds); `.txt` (Languages/About, e.g. `PublishedFileId.txt`). `Verse.ModContentLoader` _lists_ `.psd`/`.dds` among acceptable texture extensions, but its runtime decode path (`Texture2D.LoadImage`) only handles PNG/JPEG — a shipped `.psd`/`.dds` would fail to render and just bloat the download, so they're **excluded**. OS junk, editor backups (incl. `.kra` art sources), dev notes, and `Source/` can never leak into a release.
- **Self-cleaning:** `StageMod` wipes `$(StageDir)` and recopies from source, so renamed/deleted Defs/Patches/Textures never linger. The post-build `DeployToModFolder` target calls `StageMod` with `StageDir = $RIMWORLD_PATH/Mods/UniqueMeleeWeapons` (only when a local RimWorld install is detected).
- **CI reuses the same target:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` invokes `StageMod` with `-p:StageDir=<release dir>` rather than its own `cp` list, so the release zip can never drift from the local deploy. The workflow triggers on `v*.*.*` tags.
- **Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/sync-mod.sh`):** runs after each conversation turn. It rebuilds+redeploys _only when mod-relevant source/content changed since the last deploy_ (skips doc/discussion turns), logs to `$TMPDIR/umw-build.log`, and prints a warning on build failure instead of silently leaving a stale DLL in the game folder. Change-detection uses a stamp at `Source/1.6/obj/.umw-deploy-stamp`. Both the hook config (`.claude/settings.local.json`) and the helper script live under `.claude/`, which is **gitignored** — so the whole post-turn sync is local-only and untracked. If it's ever promoted to a committed config, move the helper somewhere version-controlled. The script finds the repo root via `git rev-parse`, so it works regardless of where it's relocated.

**WSL Setup:** Requires `RIMWORLD_PATH` env var in `~/.bashrc` pointing to the Windows RimWorld install (e.g., `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld`).

### Def Naming Convention

All defs use the `UMW_` prefix (Unique Melee Weapons). For a unique variant of a vanilla
weapon, mirror Odyssey's official convention of suffixing the base weapon name with `_Unique`
— e.g. the unique longsword (vanilla `MeleeWeapon_LongSword`) is `UMW_LongSword_Unique`.

**File layout:** one def per file (for discoverability) in *every* `Defs/` `.xml` — current and
any future subfolder — named after the def with the redundant `UMW_` prefix stripped — e.g.
`UMW_Serrated` → `WeaponTraitDefs/Bladed/Serrated.xml`,
`UMW_LongSword_Unique` → `ThingDefs/LongSword_Unique.xml` (the `_Unique` suffix stays; it's
meaningful). Trait files are further grouped into per-category subfolders under `WeaponTraitDefs/`
— one folder per `WeaponCategoryDef`, named after the category with the `UMW_` prefix stripped
(`Melee/`, `Bladed/`, `Pointed/`, `Blunt/`, `Heavy/`) — so a trait sits beside its siblings and
its `<weaponCategory>` is obvious from its path. RimWorld loads `Defs/` recursively and the
`StageMod` manifest is generic over the folder (its globs use `**`), so adding per-def files or
new subfolders needs no build change. Keep each category's shared theme /
on-hit-effect rationale on its `WeaponCategoryDef` file, and the broad system overview in this
doc — don't re-duplicate it across the individual trait files.

**Texture naming** also follows Odyssey: variants live in a per-weapon folder
(`Textures/Things/Item/Equipment/WeaponMelee/UniqueWeapons/<Weapon>/`) and are named
`Unique<Weapon><Letter>` with a matching `_m` colour mask — e.g. `UniqueLongSwordA.png` +
`UniqueLongSwordA_m.png`. The def's `texPath` points at the **folder** and uses
`graphicClass>UniqueMeleeWeapons.Graphic_RandomComplex` — our subclass of `Graphic_Random` (random
variant per spawn; `_m` masks auto-pair per variant). The custom class is required because vanilla
`Graphic_Random` clamps colour two to white (see the double-masking note below).

### Conventions

- **C# entry point:** `UniqueMeleeWeaponsMod` (in `Source/1.6/Core/`) applies all Harmony patches via `PatchAll()` at startup, so any `[HarmonyPatch]` class under the assembly is picked up automatically — no manual registration.
- **Namespace:** root namespace is `UniqueMeleeWeapons`. Use a `*Patches` suffix for patch namespaces (e.g. `UniqueMeleeWeapons.Patches`) to avoid RimWorld type-name conflicts.
- **Settings:** persisted via `UniqueMeleeWeaponsSettings` (ModSettings); the `Mod` subclass just delegates `DoSettingsWindowContents` → `Settings.DoWindowContents`. No configurable fields yet, but the window is pre-wired for a large list of balance toggles: the body renders inside a scroll view that only shows a scrollbar once content would overflow vertically (inner-rect height = `Mathf.Max(contentHeight, viewRect.height)`, with `contentHeight` re-measured each frame from `listing.CurHeight`), and a pinned "Reset to defaults" button calls `ResetToDefaults()`. Scroll offset/height are transient UI state and deliberately **not** scribed. To add a setting: declare the field (with default), persist it in `ExposeData` (`Scribe_Values.Look` with the same default), restore it in `ResetToDefaults`, and add a row in `DoWindowContents` (see the commented example there) — new rows need no layout bookkeeping.

### Architecture notes

One short entry per non-obvious decision (custom `CompProperties`/`Verb` subclasses, weapon
comps, Harmony patch rationale, Odyssey-specific hooks, etc.), mirroring the build-system notes.

- **Stuffable unique weapons = double-masked recolour (`Source/1.6/Things/UniqueMeleeWeapon.cs`).**
  This is the load-bearing trick of the whole mod. Odyssey's ranged uniques are *not* stuffable —
  they bake the body colour into the diffuse and use the mask only for a single forced accent
  colour. Our melee weapons *are* stuffable, so they must show **both** the material tint *and* a
  unique accent at once. We do this with one `CutoutComplex` texture:
  - **Mask red → colour one (`DrawColor`)** = the unique accent. Supplied for free by vanilla
    `CompUniqueWeapon.ForceColor()` (a random weapon `ColorDef`, or a trait's `forcedColor` like
    `UniqueWeapon_Gold`). No code needed for this half.
  - **Mask green → colour two (`DrawColorTwo`)** = the stuff/material tint *by default*. Vanilla leaves
    `DrawColorTwo` at the def's white `colorTwo`; our `thingClass` (`UniqueMeleeWeapon : ThingWithComps`)
    overrides it to `def.GetColorForStuff(Stuff)`. A trait may instead **force** colour two via our
    `ForcedColorTwoExtension` (`Source/1.6/Traits/`) — the colour-two analogue of vanilla's colour-one
    `forcedColor` (which never reaches colour two). `DrawColorTwo` checks the equipped
    `CompUniqueWeapon`'s traits for the extension and, if present, returns its `ColorDef` instead of the
    stuff tint. There is no third mask channel, so a forced body colour **replaces** the material tint
    (a forced weapon no longer shows its stuff) — first such trait wins; gate the family with its own
    `BodyColor` exclusion token (one body-colour trait per weapon). It sits on a different channel from
    the `Color`-tagged colour-one inlays, so a forced body colour *can* co-occur with a Gold/Jade inlay.
    No persistence or cache-dirtying is needed: colour two is re-derived from the (scribed) trait list at
    draw time, and traits are set in `PostPostMake` before the graphic is first built — the same timing
    that already makes colour one and the stuff tint work. `GraphicData.GraphicColoredFor` bakes both
    colours into the thing's `Graphic`, so colour two also reaches the equipped/held view. **Gotcha:** vanilla
    `Graphic_Random.GetColoredVersion` clamps colour two to white (logs *"Cannot use
    Graphic_Random.GetColoredVersion with a non-white colorTwo"*), which renders the green-masked body
    plain white. We use `Graphic_RandomComplex` (`Source/1.6/Graphics/`), a one-method subclass that
    forwards colour two; `Graphic_Single` itself already supports it.
  - **Mask black → "not painted"** = the raw diffuse, *untinted*. A black blade would therefore
    ignore its material entirely — so masks for stuffable weapons must paint the body **green**, not
    leave it black the way Odyssey's non-stuffable masks do. Keep the weapon silhouette all
    red/green, no black. Keep the diffuse light/neutral so the multiply yields a clean tint.
- **Unique-weapon traits/categories (`Defs/WeaponTraitDefs`, `Defs/WeaponCategoryDefs`).**
  `CompUniqueWeapon` rolls 1–3 `WeaponTraitDef`s filtered to the categories listed on the weapon's
  `CompProperties_UniqueWeapon`. Odyssey's stock traits are all tagged `Ranged`/`Gun`/etc., so they
  never roll on a melee-categorised weapon — melee needs its own traits (we reuse Odyssey's
  category-agnostic `ColorDef`s like `UniqueWeapon_Gold` for inlays). Generation **throws** unless at
  least one eligible trait has `canGenerateAlone=true` (the first pick) *and* the rolled set yields a
  `traitAdjective` — so every weapon's category set must include an alone-able trait with adjectives.
  Ours is guaranteed by **`UMW_Melee`'s universal `UMW_Lightweight`** plus each mechanism category's
  alone-able traits. The locked taxonomy is **5 categories**: `UMW_Melee` (universal — the six generic
  cosmetic/value/weight traits ported from Odyssey: Ornamental, Ugly, Lightweight, Cumbersome,
  Gold/Jade inlay, plus `UMW_BloodSoaked` — a gory trait that forces a body tint (colour two), panics
  humanlikes on hit, and carries a balancing equip-mood downside; see its own note below), the mechanism categories
  `UMW_Bladed`/`UMW_Pointed`/`UMW_Blunt` (each gates a distinct mechanism effect — per-tool AP/damage
  modifiers and/or on-hit effects; see the next notes),
  and the handling category `UMW_Heavy` (slow-swing stat archetypes). Within a mechanism category, traits share an `exclusionTags` token (`Edge`,
  `Point`, `Head`, `SwingProfile`) so a weapon gets at most one effect per family. `UMW_Pointed` also
  carries a second family — the **"coating" trait `UMW_Envenomed`** (a venom delivered
  on hit) — gated by a dedicated **`Coating`** token (one coating per weapon; a single trait today, but the
  token keeps any future coating exclusive). This is the melee analog
  of the `AmmoType` tag Odyssey's `ToxRounds` carries. The **`Color`** tag (the inlays')
  is applied *separately and to any mechanism trait that forces a colour-one tint*: `UMW_Envenomed` forces
  `UniqueWeapon_Tox` green so it tags `Coating`+`Color`, and `UMW_Blunt`'s `UMW_EMP` forces `UniqueWeapon_EMP`
  so it tags `Head`+`Color` (both can't co-occur with a Gold/Jade inlay; mirrors Odyssey's `EMPRounds`/`ToxRounds`,
  which tag `Color` alongside `AmmoType`). A coating
  combines freely with a point-shape trait (`Point` tag). `Color` governs only **colour one** (the red-masked accent);
  a separate **`BodyColor`** token governs **colour two** (the green-masked body, forced via
  `ForcedColorTwoExtension` — see the double-mask note). `UMW_BloodSoaked` and `UMW_Monomolecular` are the `BodyColor` members (the token keeps it to one
  body-colour trait per weapon), so a forced body colour and a `Color` accent/inlay live on different
  channels and *can* co-occur. **Discipline:** single-trait categories are fine (Odyssey
  ships several — `Rifle`/`Shotgun`/`BeamWeapon`/`LowStoppingPower` each have one); the bar is that every
  trait be mechanically **meaningful**, not that a category hit some count. `UMW_Reach` was considered for
  the spear but dropped (melee has no reach mechanic, so its traits would be flavor-only orphans).
  `UMW_Blunt`'s `Head` token gates the blunt head's one on-hit incapacitation effect — `UMW_Concussive` (a
  brief kinetic stun on flesh and mechs) **or** `UMW_EMP` (an electromagnetic, mechanoid-only stun, the melee
  port of Odyssey's `EMPRounds`; see its own note below). The old
  `UMW_Weighted` (which duplicated Concussive's stun *and* `UMW_Heavy`'s heavy-head stat profile) was removed. (A
  pure-AP blunt trait via *stats* isn't possible — melee damage and AP share `MeleeWeapon_DamageMultiplier`
  — but the per-tool `MeleeToolModExtension` could now floor a Blunt tool's AP directly if a distinct blunt
  archetype ever warranted it.) The six `UMW_Melee`
  ports are **intentional self-contained copies, not XML inheritance from Odyssey's defs** — three
  (Ornamental/Lightweight/Cumbersome) re-pointed onto melee stats because Odyssey's `RangedWeapon_*`
  mods are inert on melee, three (Ugly/Gold/Jade inlay) verbatim-equivalent. `WeaponCategoryDefs/Melee.xml`
  documents why inheritance is avoided; each ported trait file notes its deltas inline.
- **`MarketValue` convention: factor only for value-scaling, flat offset for everything else.** Mirrors
  Odyssey, which uses a `MarketValue` *factor* only for value-*scaling* traits — precious-material inlays
  (`GoldInlay ×2`, `JadeInlay ×1.4`) and quality reducers (`Ugly`/`Cumbersome ×0.8`) — while every
  added-capability trait takes a flat **offset** (a fixed fabrication cost). So: **factor ⟺ precious-inlay
  scaling or devaluation; offset ⟺ any added capability.** Our inlays/`UMW_Ugly`/`UMW_Cumbersome` keep factors,
  `UMW_BloodSoaked` keeps `×0.8` (gore devalues, an `Ugly` analog), and all functional traits use offsets sized
  from the nearest Odyssey analog (named inline in each trait file). The Heavy archetypes take offsets too despite
  their *combat* effect being a stat factor — following the precedent that Odyssey's own positive handling trait
  `Lightweight` is an offset.
- **Melee trait on-hit effects (`Source/1.6/Traits/`, `Source/1.6/Patches/Verb_MeleeAttackDamage_OnHitTraits_Patch.cs`).**
  Vanilla's mechanically interesting `WeaponTraitDef` fields — `damageDefOverride`, `extraDamages`,
  `additionalStoppingPower`, `burstShot*`, `ignoresAccuracyMaluses` — are consumed **only** by
  `Projectile`/`Verb_LaunchProjectile`, so they silently do **nothing** on a melee weapon. Only
  `statOffsets`/`statFactors` (on the live melee stats `MeleeWeapon_DamageMultiplier` — which also
  drives armor pen, there is *no* separate melee AP stat — and `MeleeWeapon_CooldownMultiplier`, plus
  `Mass`/`Beauty`/`MarketValue`), `equippedStatOffsets` (buffs the *wielder's* pawn stats), and
  `forcedColor` reach melee. To give the mechanism categories real, distinct effects we add our own
  layer: a `MeleeTraitEffectExtension : DefModExtension` (a `List<MeleeOnHitEffect>` — `…_ExtraDamage`
  for the Pointed venom coating and the Blunt `UMW_EMP` discharge, `…_Stun` for the Blunt `UMW_Concussive`
  kinetic stun, `…_MentalState` for the Blood-soaked dread/flee) attached to the trait def, fired by a
  Harmony **postfix on `Verb_MeleeAttackDamage.ApplyMeleeDamageToTarget`** (gated on a landed,
  wounding hit by a weapon with a `CompUniqueWeapon`). Using a `DefModExtension` + postfix — rather
  than subclassing `WeaponTraitDef` — keeps the trait an ordinary def, so vanilla generation/naming/
  stats stay untouched. `…_ExtraDamage` calls `Thing.TakeDamage` directly (not the verb), so it can't
  re-trigger the postfix. This same extra-damage mechanism is the path for any on-hit element that a
  `DamageDef` can carry — the Pointed **`UMW_Envenomed`** coating realises it: a self-contained
  `UMW_Stab_Tox` DamageDef (`Defs/DamageDefs/`, a `Stab` clone — `Stab` has no `Name=` so it can't be a
  `ParentName`) with the **`additionalHediffs`→`ToxicBuildup`** block lifted verbatim from Core's
  `ScratchToxic`. **Why this works on melee (verified by decompile):** unlike the ranged-only
  `damageDefOverride`, `DamageDef.additionalHediffs` is applied source-agnostically by
  **`Pawn_HealthTracker.PostApplyDamage(dinfo, totalDamageDealt)`** — reached by *every* `Thing.TakeDamage`,
  including our `…_ExtraDamage` hit — so the ToxicBuildup stacks (scaled by the venom-stab's damage
  dealt, the victim's `ToxicResistance`, and inverse body size) for free, no new C#. Incendiary would be
  the same shape: a `Flame`/`Burn` `DamageDef` via `…_ExtraDamage`. The Blunt **`UMW_EMP`** trait reuses Core's
  vanilla `EMP` `DamageDef` the same way (no clone): its `causeStun` fires source-agnostically on any `Thing.TakeDamage`
  (the path Odyssey's `EMPRounds` rides), stunning only **non-flesh** pawns — a pure anti-mechanoid effect — and `EMP`'s
  own `stunAdaptationTicks` self-limits a chain, so it needs no proc `chance` gate.
- **Base-damage conversion (`MeleeDamageConversionExtension` + `Verb_MeleeAttackDamage_DamageConversion_Patch`).**
  A trait may instead **convert** the weapon's *base* melee hit in place — rerouting one `DamageDef` to
  another, same quantity, no extra hit stacked — via a passthrough postfix on
  `Verb_MeleeAttackDamage.DamageInfosToApply` (a weapon's `meleeDamageDef` is fixed per def, so a
  trait-gated reroute must happen at runtime). `UMW_Serrated` uses it to send `Cut` → the bleedier,
  scar-prone `UMW_Cut_Ragged`, now paired with a per-tool damage split via `MeleeToolModExtension` (Cut
  ×0.9, Stab ×1.1 — see that note) rather than the old weapon-wide `MeleeWeapon_DamageMultiplier` nerf, so
  it no longer reduces armor pen. Tuning and the one-large-wound / no-split scar-curve rationale live on
  `UMW_Cut_Ragged` (`Defs/HediffDefs/`).
- **Per-tool combat modifiers (`MeleeToolModExtension` + `Verb_MeleeAttack_ToolMods_Patch`).**
  Melee damage and armor pen both ride the single weapon-wide `MeleeWeapon_DamageMultiplier` stat (there
  is *no* separate melee AP stat), and a weapon's `<tools>` are shared by every instance of its def — so
  XML alone can't raise AP without raising damage, nor modify one tool independently. The extension carries
  a list of per-capacity `MeleeToolMod`s (`damageFactor`, `armorPenetrationFloor`, `armorPenetrationFactor`),
  applied by passthrough postfixes on `VerbProperties.AdjustedMeleeDamageAmount` and `AdjustedArmorPenetration`
  (the `(Tool, Pawn, Thing, HediffComp_VerbGiver)` overloads — both reached by live combat *and* the pawn's
  stat card). AP resolves factors first, then the highest floor (floors win). `UMW_Monomolecular`/`UMW_Razored`/
  `UMW_ArmorSpike` use AP floors; `UMW_Serrated` uses per-tool damage factors (Cut −10% / Stab +10%);
  `UMW_HeadWeighted` uses an AP factor (1/1.3) to neutralize the AP its damage multiplier would otherwise
  inflate. No cache/flush — recomputed each swing from the live trait list (cf. the graphics path, which
  *does* need build-time timing). **Limitation:** the *unequipped* weapon item card shows static per-tool AP
  (the abstract `ThingDef` stat path has no instance), but vanilla returns 0 for melee AP on a non-pawn item
  anyway, so there's no regression; the *wielded* stat card is correct.
- **Blood-soaked = on-hit dread + a trait-conditioned wielder moodlet (`UMW_BloodSoaked`).** Two halves.
  (1) *Dread:* `MeleeOnHitEffect_MentalState` tries to start a `MentalStateDef` (`PanicFlee`) on a wounding
  hit, `humanlikeOnly` so animals/mechs are immune; `TryStartMentalState` is non-forced, so it no-ops
  when guards block it. (2) *Balancing downside + bloodlust upside:* **two situational `ThoughtDef`s share
  one situation-only `ThoughtWorker_BloodSoakedWeapon`** (it checks only that `pawn.equipment.Primary`'s
  `CompUniqueWeapon` carries `UMW_DefOf.UMW_BloodSoaked`; both defs use stage 0, so one `ActiveAtStage(0)`
  serves either). *All* personality routing lives in def fields, never the worker:
  - **Penalty `UMW_BloodSoakedWeapon`** — −2 mood while equipped, **nullified** for the hardened via
    `<nullifyingTraits>` (Bloodlust/Psychopath, plus VTE `VTE_Desensitized`/`VTE_WorldWeary` as `MayRequire`
    list items so the def loads without that mod) and via `<nullifyingGenes>` (`Hemogenic`, `MayRequire`
    Biotech — sanguophages etc. are inured to blood; `ThoughtUtility.NullifyingGene` reads it).
  - **Buff `UMW_BloodSoakedWeapon_Bloodlust`** — +3 mood, gated by `<requiredTraits>Bloodlust`. Bloodlusters
    *relish* the gore; mood can't flip sign within one thought (`nullifyingTraits` only zeroes), so the
    upside is a separate def. Bloodlust stays in the penalty's `nullifyingTraits`, so a bloodluster gets the
    +3 alone, not penalty + buff.

  **Gotcha (verified by decompile):** the situational pipeline (`SituationalThoughtHandler.TryCreateThought`)
  calls `CanGetThought` (which *does* enforce `requiredTraits`/`requiredGenes` — so the buff's gate works)
  but with `checkIfNullified=false`, so it does **not** apply nullification there; nullification instead runs
  in **`Thought.MoodOffset()`** (→ `ThoughtUtility.ThoughtNullified`, covering `nullifyingTraits` *and*
  `nullifyingGenes`), which *does* cover situational thoughts — so those fields work and the worker must NOT
  re-check traits/genes (mirrors vanilla `ThoughtWorker_ColonistLeftUnburied`). The trait forces the
  `UMW_Blood` `ColorDef` onto **colour two** (the body) via `ForcedColorTwoExtension` — not vanilla's
  colour-one `forcedColor` — so it tags the `BodyColor` exclusion token (the one-body-colour-per-weapon
  family, shared with `UMW_Monomolecular`), *not* the inlays' colour-one `Color` token; being on a
  different mask channel, blood-soaked can co-occur with a Gold/Jade inlay or the Envenomed coating. See the double-mask note for the colour-two path.
- **Parenting: patch a `Name=` onto the base weapon, then inherit it.** RimWorld's `ParentName`
  resolves against a node's `Name=` attribute, not its `defName`. Vanilla *ranged* weapons expose
  `Name=` (so Odyssey does `ParentName="Gun_Revolver"`), but **no concrete vanilla *melee* weapon
  does** — `ParentName="MeleeWeapon_LongSword"` raises "Could not find parent node" and the def
  fails to load. Rather than re-implement the weapon (which drifts when vanilla rebalances), we
  add the missing attribute: `Patches/AddNameToBaseMeleeWeapons.xml` does a
  `PatchOperationAttributeAdd` of `Name=<defName>` to each base weapon we mirror. Patches run
  **before** inheritance resolution (`LoadedModManager`: `ApplyPatches` → `ParseAndProcessXML`), and
  `AttributeAdd` is **add-if-missing** (skips nodes that already have it), so it's safe to stack with
  other mods. The unique def then `ParentName`s the real weapon and overrides only the deltas
  (graphic, `thingClass`, comps, reward tags, nulled `recipeMaker`) — inheriting tools/stats/stuff
  automatically. Add one patch Operation per new base weapon. **DLC-gated bases:** the Axe and
  Warhammer are Royalty weapons but the mod requires only Odyssey, so their two name patches are
  wrapped in `PatchOperationConditional` testing the base node's existence (`Defs/ThingDef[defName=…]`)
  — this tracks the actual weapon rather than a mod name, skipping cleanly with no "could not find
  node" error when Royalty is absent. Their unique defs carry `MayRequire="Ludeon.RimWorld.Royalty"`
  to match.
- **Back-reference the base via `descriptionHyperlinks`.** `<descriptionHyperlinks><ThingDef>MeleeWeapon_LongSword</ThingDef></descriptionHyperlinks>`
  — vanilla/Odyssey convention, and the link "Unique Weapons Unbound" reads to let the weapon revert
  to its base. The `_Unique` suffix alone isn't enough: our prefixed `UMW_LongSword_Unique` minus the
  suffix (`UMW_LongSword`) isn't a real def, so the explicit hyperlink is required.
- **Reward-pool separation (`ThingSetMaker_UMWUnique`, `Patches/RepointUniqueWeaponPool.xml`, `UMW_Reward_UniqueWeapon`).**
  Odyssey's `ThingSetMaker_UniqueWeapon` rolls *any* `HasComp<CompUniqueWeapon>` def via a bare
  `MakeThing(def)` (no stuff). Our melee uniques are stuffable, so that path both **errors**
  (`madeFromStuff but stuff=null` → forced to steel) and **dilutes** Odyssey's ranged-unique pool. Two
  generation styles consume unique weapons: tag-based makers (`ThingSetMaker_Count`, used by ancient
  crates / fishing / map-gen loot) already pass a stuff and so handle our weapons fine — we *keep* our
  weapons in those by leaving the `UniqueWeapon` tag on; and the class-based maker (exactly two
  consumers: `Reward_UniqueWeapon` and `MapGen_OrbitalItemStash`), which is the broken one. We split the
  pools entirely in **def space** — no Harmony, no touching Odyssey's internals: every `*_Unique` weapon
  also carries a `UMW_UniqueMelee` tag, an XPath patch repoints the two class-based consumers onto our
  `ThingSetMaker_UMWUnique` (a `ThingSetMaker_MarketValue` subclass — stuff-aware + Super-quality-preserving
  via `ThingStuffPairWithQuality.MakeThing`, value-window-honouring), and our own `UMW_Reward_UniqueWeapon`
  pool uses stock `ThingSetMaker_MarketValue` filtered to `UMW_UniqueMelee`. **Why a subclass, not a tag
  filter, for the vanilla pool:** the subclass keeps the *comp-based* candidate set (`HasComp` minus ours),
  so third-party mods' uniques stay in the pool even without the `UniqueWeapon` tag — a `tagsToAllow`
  filter would silently drop them. The detailed call-path rationale and the accepted "future mod uses the
  raw class in a new def" limitation live in the subclass's header comment.

## Debugging

1. **Enable RimWorld Dev Mode:** Settings > Dev Mode > Logging
2. **Log locations:**
   - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Player.log`
   - **WSL:** `/mnt/c/Users/*/AppData/LocalLow/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld by Ludeon Studios/Player.log`
3. **Logging:** Use `Log.Message("[Unique Melee Weapons] ...")` for mod-specific logs
4. **Inspect RimWorld API:** `ilspycmd "/mnt/c/.../RimWorldWin64_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll" -t "Namespace.ClassName"`
